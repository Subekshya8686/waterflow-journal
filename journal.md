In general,
Authentication verifies the identity of a user,
 while authorization determines the access level based on that identity.

 So, authentication says you have the 'id' so you are
 a user. It recognises everyone with the 'id' as a user.
 
 But authorization checks if your 'id' has the 
 is able to access certain functions or not.
